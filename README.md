### Welcome to my Wreath report / notes

Here I will report all of my findings during the pentest of the Wreath network of THM. I am doing this to prepare myself for the eCPPTv2 exam. I will be reporting my findings in the following way:

The Wreath path is divided in a few sections (Webserver, Pivoting, Git server, CoC, Personal PC, AV Evasion, Exfiltration and the report) I will be creating a sub-page for each one of them.
